A high-level description is available here:

The current state is between Proof-of-concept and Alpha.  Installable images will be provided once things are closer to Beta quality, for now, you have to build from source.  If you'd like to be notified when images are available, email prjx@sigbus.net and we'll let you know.

We have a IRC channel: #prjx on Freenode.
